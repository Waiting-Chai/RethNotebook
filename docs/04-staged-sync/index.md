# Chapter 4: Staged Sync (`reth-stages`)

This chapter explores Reth's staged synchronization system, a revolutionary approach to blockchain synchronization that breaks down the sync process into discrete, manageable stages. This architecture enables efficient, resumable, and parallelizable synchronization.

## Overview

Staged Sync is one of Reth's most innovative features, inspired by Erigon's approach but implemented with Rust's performance and safety guarantees. Instead of processing blocks sequentially from genesis to tip, Staged Sync separates different aspects of block processing into independent stages that can be optimized individually.

## Key Concepts

- **Pipeline Architecture**: A series of stages that process blockchain data in sequence
- **Resumable Sync**: Each stage tracks its progress, allowing interruption and resumption
- **Parallel Processing**: Stages can be optimized independently for maximum throughput
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stages process data in chunks, avoiding memory bloat
- **Incremental Updates**: Only process new data since the last sync

## Sync Stages Overview

The staged sync pipeline consists of several key stages:

1. **Headers Stage**: Downloads and validates block headers
2. **Bodies Stage**: Downloads block bodies (transactions)
3. **Senders Stage**: Recovers transaction senders from signatures
4. **Execution Stage**: Executes transactions and updates state
5. **Merkle Stage**: Builds and validates state tries
6. **Account Hashing**: Computes account hashes for state root
7. **Storage Hashing**: Computes storage hashes for contracts
8. **Finish Stage**: Finalizes the sync process

## Chapter Contents

### [Pipeline Concept & Architecture](01-pipeline-concept.md)
Understand the fundamental concepts behind staged synchronization. Learn about the pipeline architecture, stage dependencies, and how the system coordinates between different stages.

### [Stage Trait & Implementation](02-stage-trait.md)
Dive into the technical implementation of stages. Explore the `Stage` trait, how stages are defined, executed, and how they interact with the database and other system components.

### [Core Stages Analysis](03-core-stages-analysis.md)
Detailed analysis of each core stage in the pipeline. Learn about the specific responsibilities, optimizations, and implementation details of headers, bodies, execution, and other critical stages.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- The philosophy and benefits of staged synchronization
- How Reth's pipeline architecture enables efficient sync
- The role and implementation of each sync stage
- How stages coordinate and share data
- Performance optimizations and trade-offs in each stage
- How to implement custom stages for specific use cases

## Benefits of Staged Sync

- **Resumability**: Sync can be interrupted and resumed without losing progress
- **Observability**: Clear progress tracking for each stage
- **Optimization**: Each stage can be optimized independently
- **Parallelization**: Some stages can run in parallel
- **Memory Efficiency**: Controlled memory usage through staged processing
- **Debugging**: Easier to isolate and debug sync issues

## Prerequisites
