# Chapter 1: The Grand Design

Welcome to the first chapter of our journey into the source code of Reth.

Before we dive deep into specific code implementations, data structures, and algorithms, it's crucial to take some time to view the entire project from a high altitude. This is like looking at a city map before exploring it, understanding the main districts, the location of key landmarks, and the design of the transportation network.

In this chapter, we will build a high-level understanding of the Reth project. We will answer the following core questions:

- **What is Reth?** What role does it play in the vast Ethereum ecosystem?
- **What are its goals?** What core design philosophies and objectives did the Paradigm team follow while building it?
- **What is its performance secret?** We will get a first look at its most central architectural ideaâ€”"Staged Sync."
- **How is its code organized?** We will take a bird's-eye view of the entire project repository to understand its modular structure, laying the groundwork for exploring its various parts later on.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of Reth's "identity," "ideology," and "skeleton." Let's get started!
