# Chapter 6: Network & RPC

This chapter explores Reth's networking and RPC layers, which form the bridge between the Ethereum client and the outside world. These components handle peer-to-peer communication, transaction propagation, and provide JSON-RPC APIs for external applications.

## Overview

The network and RPC layers are critical for any Ethereum client, enabling it to participate in the Ethereum network and serve applications. Reth's implementation focuses on performance, reliability, and compatibility while providing a clean, modular architecture.

## Key Components

- **P2P Networking**: Connects to other Ethereum nodes for data synchronization
- **Transaction Pool**: Manages pending transactions and mempool operations
- **JSON-RPC Server**: Provides standard Ethereum APIs for external applications
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time event streaming and subscriptions
- **Network Discovery**: Finds and connects to peer nodes
- **Protocol Handlers**: Implements Ethereum wire protocols (eth, snap, etc.)

## Network Architecture

Reth's networking stack is built for scalability and performance:

1. **Async I/O**: Non-blocking network operations for high throughput
2. **Connection Management**: Efficient peer connection handling
3. **Protocol Multiplexing**: Multiple protocols over single connections
4. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Intelligent data compression and batching
5. **Security**: Built-in protection against common network attacks

## Chapter Contents

### [P2P Networking](01-p2p-networking.md)
Explore Reth's peer-to-peer networking implementation. Learn about node discovery, connection management, protocol handling, and how Reth communicates with other Ethereum clients in the network.

### [Transaction Pool](02-transaction-pool.md)
Dive into the transaction pool (mempool) implementation. Understand how pending transactions are managed, validated, prioritized, and propagated throughout the network.
