# Chapter 2: Core Primitives

Welcome to the second chapter of the Reth Notebook, where we dive deep into the foundational data structures that power Reth - the core primitives.

## What You'll Learn

This chapter covers the essential building blocks of Reth's architecture:

### üèóÔ∏è [Introduction to Primitives](./01-introduction-to-primitives)
Understand what primitives are in the context of Reth, their role in the ecosystem, and how they integrate with the Alloy framework.

### üì¶ [Core Data Types](./02-core-data-types)
Explore the fundamental data structures:
- **Block**: Complete block representation with headers and transactions
- **Header**: Block metadata including Merkle roots and consensus fields
- **Transaction**: Different transaction types (Legacy, EIP-1559, EIP-4844)

### üîß [RLP Encoding](./03-rlp-encoding)
Master the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding used throughout Ethereum:
- Encoding rules and implementation
- Performance optimizations
- Integration with Reth's data structures

## Why Primitives Matter

Primitives form the foundation of any blockchain client. In Reth, these data structures are:

- **Type-safe**: Leveraging Rust's type system for correctness
- **Performance-optimized**: Zero-copy operations where possible
- **Alloy-integrated**: Seamless compatibility with the broader Ethereum Rust ecosystem
- **Modular**: Designed for reuse across different components

## Getting Started

We recommend reading this chapter in order, starting with the [Introduction to Primitives](./01-introduction-to-primitives) to build a solid foundation before diving into specific data types and encoding mechanisms.
