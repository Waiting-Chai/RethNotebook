# Chapter 5: EVM Execution (`reth-revm`)

This chapter explores Reth's execution layer, which is responsible for processing transactions and executing smart contracts. Built on top of REVM (Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine), Reth's execution layer delivers exceptional performance while maintaining full Ethereum compatibility.

## Overview

The execution layer is where the magic happens - it's responsible for taking transactions from blocks and applying them to the blockchain state. Reth uses REVM, a high-performance Rust implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, to execute smart contracts and process transactions with industry-leading speed.

## Key Components

- **REVM Integration**: Leveraging the fastest EVM implementation available
- **Block Executor**: Orchestrates the execution of entire blocks
- **Transaction Processing**: Handles individual transaction execution
- **State Management**: Manages state changes and reverts
- **Gas Accounting**: Precise gas metering and fee calculation
- **Precompile Support**: Optimized implementations of Ethereum precompiles

## Execution Architecture

Reth's execution architecture is designed for maximum performance:

1. **Parallel Execution**: Where possible, transactions are executed in parallel
2. **Optimistic Execution**: Assumes transactions will succeed for better performance
3. **State Caching**: Intelligent caching of frequently accessed state
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage during execution
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and state reversion

## Chapter Contents

### [Introduction to REVM](01-introduction-to-revm.md)
Learn about REVM, the high-performance Rust EVM implementation that powers Reth's execution layer. Understand its architecture, performance characteristics, and how it compares to other EVM implementations.

### [Block Executor Bridge](02-block-executor-bridge.md)
Explore how Reth bridges the gap between block processing and EVM execution. Learn about the block executor architecture, batch processing, and how multiple transactions are coordinated within a single block.

### [Transaction Execution Flow](03-transaction-execution-flow.md)
Dive deep into the transaction execution process. Follow a transaction from receipt through validation, execution, state changes, and final commitment to understand the complete execution lifecycle.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:
